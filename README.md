# PCP

An afternoon project I made to visualize what the portuguese communist party members define as their professional occupations.

I used scrapy to pull the data off their website and matplotlib to plot a histogram.

To run the code, simply open the main directory in the command line and run:

'''python3 plot_ocupacoes.py'''

You'll just need to have python and matplotlib installed.
